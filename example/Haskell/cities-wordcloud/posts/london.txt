London (/ˈlʌndən/ (About this soundlisten) LUN-dən) is the capital and largest city of England, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.[9][10] Standing on the River Thames in southeastern England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[11] The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely their medieval limits.[12][13][14][15][16][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[17][note 2][18]
